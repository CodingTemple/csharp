                  <h3>Problem 1</h3>
                  <p>Create	a basic	C# console application that prints the text	"Hello	World" to the screen when run.</p>
                  <h3>Problem 2</h3>
                  <p>Write	a	C#	program	to	print	the	result	of	dividing	24	into	5	on	screen.</p>
                  <h3>Problem 3</h3>
                  <p>Write a C# program	to	print	on	screen	the	result	of	adding,	subtracting,	multiplying	and	dividing	two	numbers	typed	by	the	user.	The	remainder	of	the	division	must	be	displayed,	too.</p>
                  <code>
                      Enter	a	number:	12<br>		
                      Enter	another	number:	3<br>
                      12	+	3	=	15<br>		
                      12	-3	=	9<br>
                      12	x	3	=	36<br>
                      12	/	3	=	4<br>
                      12	mod	3	=	0<br>
                  </code>
                  <p>Convert input (which	will	always	be	a	string)	to	integer	with	the	following:</p>
                  <code>
                      string	number	=	Console.ReadLine(); <br>
                      int	num	=	Convert.ToInt32(number);<br>
                  </code>
                  <h3>Problem 4</h3>
                  <p>Write	a	C#	program	to	calculate	and	display	the	average	of	four	numbers	entered	by	the	user.</p>
                  <h3>Problem 5</h3>
                  <p>
                      Write	a	C#	program	to	get	a	number	from	the	user	and	answer	whether	it	is	positive	or	negative.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Problem 6</h3>
                  <p>
                      Create	a	program	which	assigns	a	integer	variable	"amountOfPositives"	the	value	0,	1	or	2,	depending	on	the	values	of	two	numbers	a	&amp;	b	(entered	by	the	user).	For	example,	if	the	user	enters	3	and	-2	seperately,	it	will	assign	1	to	amountofPostives	since	there	was	only	one	postive	number	out	of	the	two	entered	by	the	user.				
                  </p>
                  <h3>Problem 7</h3>
                  <p>
                      Write	a	program	that	takes	a	number	from	the	user	and	prints:	
                      
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                          <li>"fizz"	if	it	is	divisible	by	3</li>
                          <li>"buzz"	if	it	is	divisible	by	5</li>
                          <li>"fizz	buzz"	if	it	is	divisible	by	3	and	5</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Problem 8</h3>
                  <p>Write a C#	program	to get three numbers from the user and display the greatest one.</p>
                  <h3>Problem 9</h3>
                  <p>Write	a	program	that	asks	for	1	input,	a	number	score	(which	will	be	anywhere	between	0-100).	It	will	then	print	out	the	grade	(either	"A",	"B",	"C",	"D",	or	"F")	associated	with	that	number.	e.g.	"A"	will	be	printed	if	the	number	entered	was	93.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Problem 10</h3>
                  <p>
                      Write	a	program	that	takes	an	input	that	is	number,	and	will	output	all	the	numbers	between	that	number	and	0,	one	by	one.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Problem 11</h3>
                  <p>
                      Write	 a	 program,	 which	 asks	 for	 a	 character	 and	 a	 width,	 and	 displays	 a	square	 of	 that	 width,	 using	 that	 number	 for	 the	 inner	 symbol,	 as	 in	 this	Example:			
                  </p>
                  <code>
                      Enter	a	character:	z<br>		
                      Enter	the	desired	width:	3<br>
                      zzz<br>
                      zzz<br>
                      zzz<br>
                  </code>
                  <h3>Problem 12</h3>
                  <p>Print	all	the	odd	numbers	from	1	to	a	user	specifiable	upper	limit	(inclusive).  Example:</p>
                  <code>
                      Please	enter	a	number:	9<br>
                      1	3	5	7	9<br>
                  </code>
                  <h3>Problem 13</h3>
                  <p>
                      Let's	build	upon	problem	7.	Have	the	program	do	the	same	thing	except	loop	through	from	range	of	1	to	n,	printing	fizz	buzz.	If	the	number	in	the	range	is	not	divisble	by	3	or	5,	then	just	print	the	number.			Example:	
                  </p>
                  <code>
                      Enter	a	number:	16<br>
                      16<br>

                  </code>
                  <h3>Problem 16</h3>
                  <p>Given	an	even	sized	array,	determine	if	the	sum	of	the	first	half	elements	equal	the	sum	of	the	second	half.</p>
                  <code>

                      We're going to expand on Problem 9.  In addition to the Vehicle class you had previously created, create a new Class, Car, which <em>Inherits</em> from Vehicle, by defining the class as follows:
                  </p>
                  <code>
                      public class Car : Vehicle<br>

                      <br>
                      }<br>
                  </code>
                  <p>In addition to the Car class, create a Truck class which also inherits from Vehicle. Create an instance of each new class inside your main method, and assign properties to the Make, Model, Year, Color, and Miles of each. Notice that you don't need to re-define these properties on Car and Truck.  As these classes inherit from Vehicle, they already have all of the public methods and properties that vehicle has.</p>

                  <p>
                      Create a class called	Animal.  Give it the following properties:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Name (string)</li>

                  <dl>
                      <dt>Animal(string name)</dt>
                      <dd>A constructor which takes the name and assigns it to the Name property.</dd>
                      <dt>Speak()</dt>
                      <dd>A method which returns a string</dd>
                  </dl>
                  <p>Create two additional classes, Cat and Dog which inherit from Animal.  Notice that because Animal's constructor takes a parameter, Dog and Cat need constructors which can call the Animal constructor.  e.g.</p>
                  <code>public class Dog<br>{<br>public Dog(string name) : base(name) {}<br>}<br></code>
                  <p>Create a static method in your program class called WashTheAnimal, which takes a parameter of type Animal.  In your Main method, create an instance of Dog and Cat, and pass each of them to the WashTheAnimal method</p>
                  <code>
                  <pre>
public class Program

    static void	Main(string[] args)
    {
        Dog d = new Dog("Harry");
        d.Dirty = true;
        
        Cat c = new Cat("Larry");
        c.Dirty = true;

                  </code>
                  <p>Notice that I don't need to write two versions of "WashTheAnimal" for cats and dogs.  Since both classes inherit from Animal, instances of dogs and cats are valid arguments for methods which expect Animals. This technique is important, because it saves you from having to write duplicate code for each inheriting class. This concept is referred to as Polymorphism</p>

Since	the	amount	being	dispense	depends	on	salary.	}	}	4.		Create	a	class	called	Rectangle.	A.	Give	it	two	private	variables	called	Length	and	Width.	B.		Give	it	a	function	called	area	which	returns	the	area.	And	a	function	which	prints	the	details	(length	and	width)	of	Rectangle.	C.

The	above	would	throw	an	error	since	the	attributes	are	private.	*/a.getDetails();	//	should	print	'Length:	4,	Width:	5'	}	}	5.		Create	a	function/method	that	takes	a	capitalized	letter	grade	from	'A'	to	'F'.	A.	Use	a	switch	statement	to	print	the	following	for	each	case:	i.		'A':				Excellent!	ii.		'B':				Well	done!	iii.		'C':			Average,	not	bad.	iv.		'D':			You	barely	passed.	v.		'F':				Try	again	vi.		For	anything	else,	print	invalid	input.	Note	that	the	above	is	not	the	actual	syntax	for	a	switch	statement	and	printing	the	text.	6.		The	following	would	all	be	in	main.	A.	Create	an	enum	called	Temperature.	B.		Give	it	the	following	list	i.		Lowii.		Medium	iii.		High	C.		Given	a	value	from	0	to	2,	inclusive.	Use	a	switch	case	on	that	value	andprint	out	the	temperatures.

7.		The	following	code	has	an	error	(	DivideByZeroException	)	if	the	second	argument	passed	in	is	0.	A.
