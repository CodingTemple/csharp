                  <h3>Problem 11</h3>
                  <p>
                      Write	 a	 program,	 which	 asks	 for	 a	 character	 and	 a	 width,	 and	 displays	 a	square	 of	 that	 width,	 using	 that	 number	 for	 the	 inner	 symbol,	 as	 in	 this	Example:			
                  </p>
                  <code>

                  <h3>Problem 13</h3>
                  <p>
                      Let's	build	upon	problem	7.	Have	the	program	do	the	same	thing	except	loop	through	from	range	of	1	to	n,	printing	fizz	buzz.	If	the	number	in	the	range	is	not	divisble	by	3	or	5,	then	just	print	the	number.			Example:	
                  </p>
                  <code>
                      Enter	a	number:	16<br>

                      We're going to expand on Problem 9.  In addition to the Vehicle class you had previously created, create a new Class, Car, which <em>Inherits</em> from Vehicle, by defining the class as follows:
                  </p>
                  <code>
                      public class Car : Vehicle<br>
                      {<br>
                      <br>

                  </code>
                  <p>In addition to the Car class, create a Truck class which also inherits from Vehicle. Create an instance of each new class inside your main method, and assign properties to the Make, Model, Year, Color, and Miles of each. Notice that you don't need to re-define these properties on Car and Truck.  As these classes inherit from Vehicle, they already have all of the public methods and properties that vehicle has.</p>
                  <code>
                  <pre>

        t.Miles = 100;

                  <p>
                      Create a class called	Animal.  Give it the following properties:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Name (string)</li>
                      <li>Dirty (bool)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <dl>
                      <dt>Animal(string name)</dt>
                      <dd>A constructor which takes the name and assigns it to the Name property.</dd>
                      <dt>Speak()</dt>
                      <dd>A method which returns a string</dd>
                  </dl>
                  <p>Create two additional classes, Cat and Dog which inherit from Animal.  Notice that because Animal's constructor takes a parameter, Dog and Cat need constructors which can call the Animal constructor.  e.g.</p>
                  <code>public class Dog<br>{<br>public Dog(string name) : base(name) {}<br>}<br></code>
                  <p>Create a static method in your program class called WashTheAnimal, which takes a parameter of type Animal.  In your Main method, create an instance of Dog and Cat, and pass each of them to the WashTheAnimal method</p>
                  <code>
                  <pre>
public class Program
{
    static void	Main(string[] args)
    {
        Dog d = new Dog("Harry");
        d.Dirty = true;
        
        Cat c = new Cat("Larry");
        c.Dirty = true;
        
        WashTheAnimal(d);
        WashTheAnimal(c);
    }	
    
    private static void WashTheAnimal(Animal a)
    {
        a.Dirty = false;
        Console.WriteLine(a.Name + " is clean");
    }
}
                  </pre>
                  </code>
                  <p>Notice that I don't need to write two versions of "WashTheAnimal" for cats and dogs.  Since both classes inherit from Animal, instances of dogs and cats are valid arguments for methods which expect Animals. This technique is important, because it saves you from having to write duplicate code for each inheriting class. This concept is referred to as Polymorphism</p>
                  <h3>Problem 14</h3>
                  <p>Create	a class	called BankAccount, give it the following properties:

                      <dd>A constructor which assigns each parameter to the appropriate property.</dd>
                      <dt>BankAccount(string accountNumber, string	owner)</dt>
                      <dd>A constructor which assigns the accountNumber and owner properties, but default balance to 0</dd>
                      <dt>Withdraw(decimal amount)</dt>
                      <dd>Updates balance by subtracing the amount parameter to the balance.</dd>
                      <dt>Deposit(decimal amount)</dt>
                      <dd>Updates the balance by adding the amount parameter to the balance.</dd>
                      <dt>AddInterest()</dt>
                      <dd>This will be used to update the balance with a compound interest rate.  In the "BankAccount" base class, we'll leave this method empty</dd>
                  </dl>
                  <p>We'll be using a new C# keyword, <em>virtual</em>, as a modifier on the Withdraw, Deposit, and AddInterest methods. The method signature will look like this:</p>
                  <code>public virtual void AddInterest()</code>
                  <p>Create two classes, CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount, which inherit from BankAccount. CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount need two constructors each, which in turn will call the BankAccount constructors, as we did in Problem 13.</p>
                  <p>While BankAccount provides an implementation for Deposit, Withdraw, and AddInterest, by marking them as virtual, you are allowed to <em>override</em> the default implementations in derived classes.  Use the override keyword to do so:</p>
                  <code>public override void Deposit()</code>
                  <p>Override the withdraw method in both classes, and make sure that someone cannot withdraw more money than is present in their account.  Futhermore, in the SavingsAccount, make that someone cannot withdraw more than 10% of their current balance. </p>
                  <code>if(amount > (this.Balance * 0.10))</code>
                  <p>In the SavingsAccount, override the AddInterest method so that the balance is increased by 0.2% when the method is called.</p>

                  <p>Create	a console application. Notice that the Program class is created inside of the Namespace which matches the name of our project. Create two additional classes, each called Person, but create one inside of a namespace <em>ns1</em>, while the other will be inside of a namespace <em>ns2</em>.  Each person class should have a single method, Print, which prints out "I am from ns2" in the ns2 namespace, and "I am from ns1" inside the ns1 namespace.</p>
                  <p>In the Main method of your program class, create an instance of each type of Person and call the Print method.</p>
                  <code>

                  <p>
                      We're going to modify our Week 2 : Problem 11 program to make our Employee class part of a Human Resources Payroll system. We'll make a slight change to the existing employee class.  Instead of "Salary" being marked as a public property, we're going to modify it using the Private keyword access modifier:
                  </p>
                  <code>private decimal Salary {get; set;}</code>
                  <p>By marking the salary property private, only methods and properties defined inside of the Employee class can change the Salary property. You can read more about access modifiers here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers</a>
                  </p>
                  <p>We'll be adding two other methods to our employee class:</p>
                  <dl>
                      <dt>Dispense()
                      </dt>
                      <dd>Returns a decimal of the Salary divided by 26.  This is the bi-monthly paycheck amount the employee receives.</dd>
                      <dt>Promote(decimal additionalPay, string newJobTitle)</dt>
                      <dd>
                          Adds an amount to an employee's salary, and changes their job title.

                      While this is an oversimplified example of how developers use the private keyword, in practice it forces us to interact with code through a well-defined contract.  This is the principal of <em>Encapsulation.</em>

                  <h3>Problem 3</h3>
                  <p>We're going to re-write Week 1 - Problem 9 to use the "switch" keyword".  Here's an implementation of the Problem to start with:</p>
                  <code>
                      <pre>
                      
Console.WriteLine("Enter your score");
string input = Console.ReadLine();
int grade = int.Parse(input);
int leadingDigit = grade / 10;

if(leadingDigit == 10)
{
    Console.WriteLine("A");
}
else if(leadingDigit == 9)
{
    Console.WriteLine("A");
}
else if(leadingDigit == 8)
{
    Console.WriteLine("B");
}
else if(leadingDigit == 7)
{
    Console.WriteLine("C");
}
else if(leadingDigit == 6)
{
    Console.WriteLine("D");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("F");
}
                      </pre>
                  </code>
                  <p>Change the if/else block to use the switch, case, default, and break keywords.</p>
                  <h3>Problem 4</h3>
                  <p>
                      We're going to modify our Week 2 - Problem 9 to enforce some additional rules about our Vehicle.  For the purposes of this exercise, we want to limit our set of "makes" to the following: GM, Ford, Lincoln, Chrysler, Cadillac, Jeep, Tesla, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Infiniti, Honda, Toyota, MercedesBenz, Audi, BMW, Volkswagen.  Rather than marking the Make property as a string, we're going to use an Enum structure to create this restriction. Add the following code to your project:</p>
                  <code>
                      <pre>
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Vehicle v1 = new Vehicle();
        v1.Make	= "Ford";   //This line is going to need to change
        v1.Model = "T";
        v1.Color = "Brown";
        v1.Miles = 1000m;
        v1.Year = 1925;
        
    }
    
}

public class Vehicle
{  
    //...Your existing code should still be in here
    public VehicleMake Make { get; set;}

}

public enum VehicleMake
{
    GM, 
    Ford, 
    Lincoln, 
    Chrysler, 
    Cadillac, 
    Jeep, 
    Tesla, 
    Nissan, 
    Mitsubishi, 
    Infiniti, 
    Honda, 
    Toyota, 
    MercedesBenz, 
    Audi, 
    BMW, 
    Volkswagen
}
                      </pre>
                  </code>
                  <p>
                      
                      Using the supplied code, modify the Program's Main method so that the Make is set correctly.  Visual Studio's IntelliSense capability should "suggest" the correct way to write this.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Problem 5</h3>
                  <p>
                      We're going to re-run our Week 1 : Problem 3 code, but pass in some different parameters:
                  </p>
                  <code>
                      <pre>
Console.WriteLine("Enter a number");
string input = Console.ReadLine();
int a = int.Parse(input);


Console.WriteLine("Enter another number");
input = Console.ReadLine();
int b = int.Parse(input)

Console.WriteLine("{0} + {1} = {2}", a, b, a + b);
Console.WriteLine("{0} - {1} = {2}", a, b, a - b);
Console.WriteLine("{0} * {1} = {2}", a, b, a * b);
Console.WriteLine("{0} / {1} = {2}", a, b, a / b);
Console.WriteLine("{0} mod {1} = {2}", a, b, a % b);

Console.ReadLine();
                      </pre>
                  </code>
                  <p>
                      What happens if you enter the value "0" for your second parameter?  Alternatively, what happens if you type "hot dogs" instead of a number? In either case, this will cause what is referred to as an <em>exception</em>, sometimes referred to as a <em>runtime error</em>. Even though your code compiled, the user was able to enter input which your code did not expect. Professional developers are expected to practice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming">defensive programming</a> to guard against this. In C#, an unhandled exception or runtime error will immediately terminate execution of the program, so as to avoid executing code which is in an unexpected state and causing undesirable side effects to your system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      One of the basic techniques to harden your code against these sort of situations is to introduce some basic exception handling structures in your code:
                  </p>
                  <code>
                      <pre>
int a = 20;
int b = 10;
int c = 0;

try
{
    int result1 = a / b;
}
catch(Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}

try
{
    int result2 = a / c;
}
catch(System.DivideByZeroException ex)  //This will only catch "DivideByZeroException" objects
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}

                        
                      </pre>
                  </code>
                  <p>
                      Modify the problem above to handle passing 0 as the second number. If you're feeling ambitious, try handling the int.Parse exception that occurs when a user types in something that isn't a number, as well.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Problem 6</h3>
                  <p>
                      Take a look at the following code:
                      <code>
                      <pre>
                      
public class Rectangle
{
    //The underscore is a "style guideline"
    //but has no effect on how this compiles or runs.
    private double _length;     
    private double _width;

    public Rectangle(double length, double width)
    {
        _length = length;
        _width = width;
    }
    
    public double Perimeter
    {  
        get
        {
            return 0;   //This isn't correct
        }
        
    }
    
    public double Area
    {
        get
        {
            return 0;   //Neither is this
        } 
    }
}
                </pre>
                      </code>
                          
                      
                      <p>In this case, we don't supply a way to set Area or Perimeter, since these values are derived from the length and width.  Notice that the Perimeter and Area methods don't return the correct values:</p>
                        <code>Rectangle r = new Rectangle(4, 5);<br>Console.WriteLine(r.Area); //Should be 20, but prints 0</code>
                  <p>This is an interesting example of code which compiles, runs without generating any exceptions, but is functionally incorrect. While you might notice this if you spent some time looking at the code, these sorts of defects are often much more subtle.  To improve the quality of code, professional developers rely on automated <em>Unit Tests</em> to verify that their code not only compiles, but functionally works as expected</p>
                  <p>Visual Studio provides support for several Unit Test frameworks. Take a second to review this information here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/unit-test-basics">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/unit-test-basics</a>
                  </p>
                  <p>Once you've read up on the Tools and Processes associated with Unit Tests, create two Unit Tests for the Perimeter and Area properties, respectively.  Use the Test Explorer Window to execute your Unit Tests: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/run-unit-tests-with-test-explorer">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/run-unit-tests-with-test-explorer</a>
                  </p>
